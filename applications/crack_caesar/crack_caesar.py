# Use frequency analysis to find the key to ciphertext.txt, and then
# decode it.

# Your code here


# The frequency analysis process consists of the following steps:

# Create a list of plaintext frequencies, sorted by frequency

# Create a list of encrypted text frequencies, sorted by frequency

# Merge these lists to create an estimated mapping between encrypted letters and plaintext letters

# Use this mapping to create an approximate decryption of the encrypted text
